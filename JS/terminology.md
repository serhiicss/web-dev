**coercion**: type coercion means that when the operands of an operator are different types, one of them will be converted to an "equivalent" value of the other operand's type. `2 * "2" // 4`  
**dynamic typing**: variables can hold values of any type without any type enforcement.  
**expression**:  is any reference to a variable or value, or a set of variable(s) and value(s) combined with operators.  
**execution context**: execution scope?  
**immutable**: cann't be changed  
**first class functions**: functions are objecets  
**function decaration**: declare a function `function foo(){...}`   
**function expression**: assigning a function to a variable `var foo = function(){...}`  
**function context**: function level scope  
**literal value**: is any part of a statement or expression that is to be used exactly as it is, rather than as a variable or a Lingo element. `a = b * 2;` -> `2` is a literal value.  
**mutate**: change something    
**name identifier**: function of variable name `function foo(){...}` -> `foo` is the name identifier  
statement: a group of words, numbers, and operators that performs a specific task. `a = b * 2;`  
**namespace**: a container for variables and functions  
**object literal**: a comma-separated list of name-value pairs wrapped in curly brackets  
**operator**: performs actions with the values and variables such as assignment and mathematic multiplication. `=`, `+`.  
**outer environmnet**: an outer(next one up) scope  
**scope**: aka `lexical scope`, aka `lexical envoriment`. a collection of variables as well as the rules for how those variables are accessed by name.  
**scope chain**: traversing up the chain of scopes
 **syntax parser**: 
**variable declaration**: declare a varialbe `var foo;`  
**variable assigment**: assign a value to a variable `foo = 2`
