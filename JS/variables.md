### Variable Lifetime
---
**Global variables** live as long as your application (your window / your web page) lives.

**Local variables** have short lives. They are created when the function is invoked, and deleted when the function is finished.

`var a = 2;`  
`var` is **variable declraration**,  
`a`   is **identifier**,  
`=`   is **assignment expression**,  
`2`   is **numeric literal**
